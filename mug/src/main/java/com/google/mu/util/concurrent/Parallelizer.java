/**
 * Utility to support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_concurrency">structured
 * concurrency</a> for <em>IO-bound</em> subtasks of a single unit of work, while limiting the max
 * concurrency.
 *
 * <p>For example, the following code saves a stream of {@code UserData} in parallel with at most 3
 * concurrent RPC calls at the same time:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * new Parallelizer(executor, 3)
 *     .parallelize(userDataStream.filter(UserData::isModified), userService::save);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Similar to parallel streams (and unlike executors), these sub-tasks are considered integral
 * parts of one unit of work. Failure of any sub-task aborts the entire work, automatically. If an
 * exception isn't fatal, the sub-task should catch and handle it.
 *
 * <p>How does it stack against parallel stream itself?
 * The parallel stream counterpart to the above example use case may look like:
 * <pre>  {@code
 *   userDataStream.filter(UserData::isModified).parallel().forEach(userService::save);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * A few key differences: <ul>
 * <li>A parallel stream doesn't use arbitrary {@link ExecutorService}. It by default uses
 *     either the enclosing {@link ForkJoinPool} or the common {@code ForkJoinPool} instance.
 * <li>By running in a dedicated {@link ForkJoinPool}, a parallel stream can take a custom target
 *     concurrency, but it's not guaranteed to be <em>max</em> concurrency.
 * <li>Parallel streams are for CPU-bound computations; while {@code Parallelizer} deals with
 *     IO-bound operations.
 * <li>{@link #parallelize parallelize()} can be interrupted, and can time out;
 *     parallel streams are uninterruptible.
 * <li>When a task throws, {@code Parallelizer} dismisses pending tasks, and cancels all in-flight
 *     tasks (it's up to the user code to properly handle thread interruptions).
 *     So if a worker thread is waiting on some resource, it'll be interrupted without hanging
 *     the thread forever.
 * <li>{@code Parallelizer} wraps exceptions thrown by the worker threads, making stack trace
 *     clearer.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>And how do you choose between {@code Parallelizer} and {@link ExecutorService}?
 * Could you use something like the following instead?
 * <pre>  {@code
 *   ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
 *   try {
 *     List<Future<?>> futures = userData
 *         .filter(...)
 *         .map(() -> pool.submit(() -> userService.save(data)))
 *         .collect(toList());
 *     for (Future<?> future : futures) {
 *       future.get();
 *     }
 *   } finally {
 *     pool.shutdownNow();
 *   }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * Some differences for consideration:<ul>
 * <li><b>Memory Concern</b>
 *     <ul>
 *     <li>The thread pool queues all pending tasks. For large streams (like reading hundreds
 *         of thousands of task input data from a file), it can run out of memory quickly.
 *      <li>Storing all the future objects in a list may also use up too much memory for large
 *          number of sub tasks.
 *     </ul>
 * <li><b>Exception Handling (and fail fast)</b>
 *     <ul>
 *     <li>Executors treat submitted tasks as independent. One task may fail and the other tasks
 *         won't be affected.
 *
 *         <p>But for co-dependent sub tasks that were parallelized only for performance reasons
 *         (as in parallel streams), you'll want to abort the whole parallel pipeline upon any
 *         critical exception, the same as if they were run sequentially.
 *
 *         <p>Aborting a parallel pipeline requires complex concurrent logic to coordinate between
 *         the sub tasks and the executor in order to dismiss pending sub tasks and also to cancel
 *         sub tasks that are already running. Otherwise, when an exception is thrown from a sub
 *         task, the other left-over sub tasks will continue to run, some may even hang
 *         indefinitely.
 *     <li>Automatic cancellation propagation. When {@link #parallelize parallelize()} is
 *         interrupted, all running tasks will be automatically canceled; all pending tasks
 *         automatically dismissed.
 *     <li>You may resort to shutting down the executor to achieve similar result (cancelling the
 *         left-over sub tasks). Although even knowing whether a sub task has failed isn't trivial.
 *         The above code example uses {@link Future#get}, but it won't help if a sub task
 *         submitted earlier is still running or being blocked, while a later-submitted sub task
 *         has failed.
 *     <li>And, {@code ExecutorService}s are often set up centrally and shared among different
 *         classes and components in the application. You may not have the option to create and
 *         shut down a thread pool of your own.
 *     </ul>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Stream parameters used in this class are always consumed in the calling thread and don't have
 * to be thread safe.
